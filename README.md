# MemeMaker
A Unity project to generate unique 2D memes based on a background and 4 or more accesory zones. The script loads however many images are in each sub-folder of the Resources folder. It then randomly picks either one texture or no texture from each zone. By having 10 items in each of the 4 zones it is possible to generate 10,000 unique memes.

If a background and background palette is specified, each meme gets a random background color based off the palette, otherwise the background will be the same for all of them. It would be easy to extend that to other items of the base character, like the face or clothing base. Just replicate the code used for the background to whatever other part you wish.
